Tata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS) stock has recently experienced significant price fluctuations driven primarily by the impact of India's GST 2.0 reforms and broader market sentiment.  Key events include price cuts across various Tata Motors vehicles following the GST overhaul, leading to a surge in auto stock prices, with Tata Motors among the top gainers.  This positive sentiment was further boosted by a Bank of America upgrade.  However, counterpoints exist, including concerns about a previous 45% crash from the stock's peak and ongoing questions about whether the current rally represents a genuine turnaround or a temporary bounce.  Further complicating the picture is a reported global IT issue impacting Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), a Tata Motors subsidiary.  While analysts express differing opinions, with some suggesting long-term buy potential, others highlight the risks.  Overall, the sentiment surrounding Tata Motors is currently positive due to the GST-related price cuts and subsequent market gains, but uncertainty remains regarding the sustainability of this trend and the long-term implications of JLR's IT issues.
